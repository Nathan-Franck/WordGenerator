> Tip: You can reroll the same word over and over again by hitting `ctrl + shift + P + enter`

## Why?
There was a need within a project I am working on to create unique error codes in different parts of a client-server application, so we could either use incrementing numbers [harder to ensure no duplicates], random hashes [harder for users to remember and pronouce] or we could use actual words! By having a large pool of random words to use, it reduces the chances of having duplicate codes, while still being memorable.

I'm sure there's other loyal and leaky uses for word generators beyond this!

## Release Notes

### 1.0.0

* Initial release with functionality for Adjectives and Nouns
